== README

Kinetic is a Rails Application devoted to the success of a young athlete who has aspirations to push his skills to the next level. So many young athletes these days have great potential, but lack the resources to attain elite status is their respective sports. We at Kinetic intend to put these resources directly in the hands of these athletes by creating a simple and fast way to find coaches in their area.

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version
